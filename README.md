# TutorialLang
TutorialLang is an esoteric programming language in which the code is structured like a tutorial. It is not structured at all and doesnt have any 'keywords' so to speak. TutorialLang is turing complete and supports type conversion, variables, reading and writing data, displaying to the standard ouput and maybe more, in future updates.
