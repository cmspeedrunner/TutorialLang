Welcome to my variable tutorial.
First, to start, we are going to allocate 400 into the variable x.
Now, we are going to output our variable x+x.
This should output 800.

Now we are going to do some string variable testing.
Ok, so to start lets allocate "Hello, World!" into the variable y.
Now, lets output our variable y.

Thats it, thanks for reading it.
